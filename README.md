# TPlanet
GUI for [Torbenm's Planet Generator](http://www.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/).

Uses [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) to create a Desktop App.

Currently requires the user to manually edit TPDir within index.js to specify the directory of Torbenm's Planet Generator on your Desktop.

This project is still being developed on Windows, but I intend to take advantage of Electron's cross platform support once the base design is in place.
