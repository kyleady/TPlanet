# TPlanet
GUI for [Torbenm's Planet Generator](http://www.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/). Uses [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) to create a Desktop App.

The planet generator must be installed on your computer. Upon first launching the GUI, it will ask for the directory of the generator, planet.exe.

If you need to change the directory for planet.exe, you can go to File->Preferences to edit the directory path.

Whenever you make an edit, a small resoultion map will be produced as a preview. The preview width can be editted within File->Preferences. The preview height will be scaled down proportionally.

In order to create a detailed version of your map, you must hit the "Detail" button.

Whenever you edit a color scheme (by clicking on the colors), your latest edits will be saved within custom.col.

To get a new seed for a map, hit the "New" button.

Your custom Color Files can be saved with File->Save Color File.

Your detailed map can be saved with File->Save Map. This command will not save a map preview.
